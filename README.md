## About
This portfolio highlights my work as a frontend developer with experience in the MERN stack, e-commerce platforms, and blog applications. Designed to impress potential clients and employers, it features a clean, responsive interface with smooth animations, a dark theme toggle, and multilingual support (English, Arabic, Spanish). The site is deployed on Netlify for fast, reliable performance.

Key projects include:
- **Portfolio**: A dynamic showcase of my work with animated project cards.
- **E-Commerce App**: An online store with Stripe integration and MongoDB backend.
- **Blog App**: A MERN-based platform for posts and comments with Redux state management.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly layout using Tailwind CSS grid and responsive typography (`text-base sm:text-lg`, `text-xl sm:text-2xl`).
- **Dark Theme**: Toggleable light/dark mode with `localStorage` persistence, styled with Tailwind’s `dark:` variants.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports English, Arabic (RTL), and Spanish using `next-intl`, with a sleek language switcher.
- **Animations**: Smooth fade-in and stagger effects for project cards using Framer Motion’s `staggerChildren`.
- **Clean Code**: Modular Next.js structure with TypeScript for type safety (e.g., `Data` interface for project cards).
- **Contact Integration**: Telegram link ([@moha2000yahoo](https://t.me/moha2000yahoo)) for direct communication.
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and locale-based routing (`/en`, `/ar`, `/es`) for global accessibility.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Internationalization**: `next-intl` for multilingual support
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Other**: `localStorage` for theme/language persistence, Vercel (optional for local testing)
