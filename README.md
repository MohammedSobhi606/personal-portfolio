About
This portfolio highlights my work as a frontend developer with experience in the MERN stack, e-commerce platforms, and blog applications. Designed to impress potential clients and employers, it features a clean, responsive interface with smooth animations, a dark theme toggle, and multilingual support (English, Arabic, Spanish). The site is deployed on Netlify for fast, reliable performance.
Key projects include:

Portfolio: A dynamic showcase of my work with animated project cards.
E-Commerce App: An online store with Stripe integration and MongoDB backend.
Blog App: A MERN-based platform for posts and comments with Redux state management.

Features

Responsive Design: Fully mobile-friendly layout using Tailwind CSS grid and responsive typography (text-base sm:text-lg, text-xl sm:text-2xl).
Dark Theme: Toggleable light/dark mode with localStorage persistence, styled with Tailwindâ€™s dark: variants.
Multilingual Support: Supports English, Arabic (RTL), and Spanish using next-intl, with a sleek language switcher.
Animations: Smooth fade-in and stagger effects for project cards using Framer Motionâ€™s staggerChildren.
Clean Code: Modular Next.js structure with TypeScript for type safety (e.g., Data interface for project cards).
Contact Integration: Telegram link (@moha2000yahoo) for direct communication.
SEO Optimized: Proper meta tags and locale-based routing (/en, /ar, /es) for global accessibility.
